# What is this?

This is a framework template that provides a foundation for creating simple games. It also provides a simple level editor for quickly modifying game levels. This is not a game engine, you are expected to code most of the game, the level editor is simply there to help build the levels.

This repository is separated into two folders:
- Level editor
- Game

Level editor holds the source code and files to the level editor itself. Game is the folder containing a template game project you can continue working off of to make your game with it.

Features:
- Info coming soon.
